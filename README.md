This repository contains the source code written in C of the projects mentioned in the Arduino StarterKit. My motivation is to use Atmel Studio 7 on Windows 10 and write all necessary functions purely in C. The Arduino works with a ATmega328P micro controller.

The projects are slightly modified but always include the most important (new) functionalities compared to the previous project.
